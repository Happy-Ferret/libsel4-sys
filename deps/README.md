Note that the libsel4-sys project itself is licensed under MIT,
and makes use of seL4 through the BSD 2-Clause license.

The GPLv2 license is reproduced here for clarity, but does not
affect the use of libsel4-sys as the seL4 related code is incorporated
without modification via git, and built using input-piping wrappers
around seL4's own unmodified build infrastructure.
